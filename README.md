The final business report is a comprehensive analysis focusing on data mining techniques applied to two datasets: bank marketing and insurance. It involves a series of detailed steps, including initial data exploration, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The report evaluates the necessity of scaling for clustering and applies hierarchical and K-Means clustering methods to the scaled data, determining optimal clusters through dendrograms, elbow curves, and silhouette scores. Additionally, the report includes the creation of cluster profiles and suggests promotional strategies for different clusters. For classification models, the report splits the data into test and train sets and builds models using CART, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks. Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and ROC_AUC scores are used to evaluate model performance. The final model is chosen based on a comparison of all models, and business insights and recommendations are provided based on the overall analysis.
